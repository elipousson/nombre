> *nombre* (French) `r sampa("/nO~bR/")`: number  
> *nombre* (Spanish) `r sampa("/\"nom.b4e/")`: name  
> `nombre`: package to convert numbers to their names in R

**nombre** converts numeric vectors to character vectors of English words.
You can use it to express numbers as cardinals (one, two, three) or ordinals (first, second, third), as well as numerators and denominators. **nombre** supports not just whole numbers, but also negatives and fractions.

## Installation

You can install the development version of **nombre** from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("rossellhayes/nombre")
```

## Usage

```{r include = FALSE}
library(nombre)
```

**nombre** converts numerics into words:

```{r}
nom_card(2)
nom_card(2L)
x <- rep(TRUE, 525600)
nom_card(length(x))
```

It also works for numeric vectors:

```{r}
nom_card(8^(1:10))
```

**nombre** can also generate ordinals, numerators and denominators:

```{r}
nom_ord(1:5)
nom_numer(1:5)
nom_denom(1:5)
nom_denom(1:5, numerator = 1:5)
```

> `r emo::ji("shushing")` (numerators are almost always the same as cardinals)

It can also handle less common numerics, like negative and fractions:

```{r}
nom_card(-2)
nom_card(99.9)
```

## Advantages `r emo::ji("rocket")`

**nombre** is implemented using vectorized base R.
This allows it to run faster than options that implement their own object class, like [**english**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/english/):

```{r}
bench::mark(nom_card(1:1000), as.character(english::english(1:1000)))
```

**nombre** also does not require dependencies for most of its functionality.
The suggested package [**MASS**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/) is only required for handling non-integers, a situation that should be rare for most packages considering implementing **nombre**.
